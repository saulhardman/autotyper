## Description

If this is a feature request, explain why it should be added. Specific use-cases are best.

For bug reports, please provide as much *relevant* info as possible as well as a reduced test case (see below).

## Reduced Test Case

We ask that you provide a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) demonstrating your use-case and the problem you've come across.

There are examples of `autotyper` standard usages on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/collection/Drkmyk):

- [Element Example](http://codepen.io/saulhardman/pen/JEWJeE)
- [jQuery Example](http://codepen.io/saulhardman/pen/apmJva)

Fork the relevant example, recreate your test case, and provide a link here:
